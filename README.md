# CS410 Portfolio Project

Rendered to my GitHub personal web space using `gh-pages` which renders my React app locally
and pushes it to a specified branch; in this case: `master`. Given that, the master branch only
contains rendered content where the code that generated it lives in `develop`.

### made using:

`gh-pages`: [gh-pages npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages)  
`create-react-app`: [create-react-app github](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)  
`bootstrap`: [bootstrap homepage](https://getbootstrap.com/)
